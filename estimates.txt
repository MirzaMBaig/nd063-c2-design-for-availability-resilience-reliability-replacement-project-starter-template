Availability Estimate

Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
A.For multi AZ scenario, its nearly zero RTO as the failover is automatic and the standby instance is already up and running.
A.For only single AZ when we have EBS backup, The RTO can last from a few minutes to several hours depending on the size of the database and the time it takes to restore the database from the EBS snapshot.
The Single-AZ instance is not the best fit for production workloads where high availability is required.
However, it can be a good fit for development or testing purposes where applications do not require high availability, automatic failover, or low RTO/RPO.

2.Minimum RTO for a single region outage
A. For single region outage, the RTO can last from a few minutes to several hours depending on the size of the database and the time it takes to restore the database from the EBS snapshot.
A. For multi region scenario, the RTO can last from few mins to hour depending on persons availability to switch the traffic to the replica region.

3.Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
A. For single AZ, the RPO jus is nearly zero.
A. For multi AZ, its also nearly zero as the RPO depends on when it detects the outrage and switches to the next available AZ.

4.Minimum RPO for a single region outage
A. For single region outrage, the RPO is nearly zero.
A. For multi region, its also nearly zero as the RPO depends when it detects the outrage.
