Availability Estimate

Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
A
A.The RTO can last from a few minutes to several hours.
The Single-AZ instance is not the best fit for production workloads where high availability is required.
However, it can be a good fit for development or testing purposes where applications do not require high availability, automatic failover, or low RTO/RPO.

Minimum RTO for a single region outage
A. In the event of Availability Zone failure, your workload automatically fails over to standby instances in the same region. The failover typically takes 60â€“120 seconds.
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
A. Due to the lack of standby instances, a Single-AZ instance cannot failover during an AZ outage. The RPO with an Amazon RDS Single-AZ instance is typically 5 minutes,
which is based on the timeout interval for copying transaction logs to Amazon S3.
This time may vary due to open transactions, engine specific settings, loss of network connectivity to Amazon S3, and instance class (network/disk/heavy workload) limits.
